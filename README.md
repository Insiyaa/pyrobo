# Introduction
This repository maintains simple examples of machine learning using python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, pandas etc. 

# Algorithms
This library currently includes examples of following algorithms of Machine Learning. 

        1. Linear Regression
        2. Logistics Regression
        3. Decision Tree
        4. K Means Clustering
        5. K Nearest Neighbours
        6. Support Vector Mechanics
  
Code snippet for the above algorithms can be found in "dev" Branch. 

# Upcoming Functionality and Fetaures
First release includes examples of basic algorithms only. Examples to following complex algorithms will be available soon.

        1. Random Forest
        2. Gradient Boost
        3. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) or Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm
        4. Naive Bayes
