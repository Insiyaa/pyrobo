# Introduction
This repository maintains simple examples of machine learning using python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, pandas etc. 

# Algorithms
This library currently includes examples of following algorithms of Machine Learning. 

        1. Linear Regression
        2. Logistics Regression
        3. Decision Tree
        4. K Means Clustering
        5. K Nearest Neighbours
        6. Support Vector Mechanics
        7. Random Forest
        8. Gradient Boost

Code snippet for the above algorithms can be found in "dev" Branch. 

# Upcoming Functionality and Fetaures
